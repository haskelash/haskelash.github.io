Hello world! I'm excited to be writing my first (of hopefully many) blog posts. I've wanted to start a blog for quite some time now. I finally got around to it, and after many hours of setup and reading documentation with GitHub Pages and Jekyll -- remember, I'm an iOS dev, not a web dev ;) -- I'm thrilled to be getting started.  And now, a couple of lists:

Why I'm starting this blog:

- To give back to the dev comunity that has already given me so much
- To commit what I learn to writing so that I have a log of what I've learned
- To share my ideas and projects with other people

What I'll be blogging about:

- Cool new things I learn in Swift and Objective-C
- Cool old things I review in Swift and Objective-C
- Web dev tutorials as I update and modify this site
- Anouncements of new features to the site (marked with the `meta` tag)
- Non-tech stuff I feel like writing about (marked with the `nontech` tag)

So thanks for being part of the beginning of this fun journey of mine, come back often, and let me know what you think!
